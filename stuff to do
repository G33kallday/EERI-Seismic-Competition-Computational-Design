3D modeling

description:
need to model the building. This includes nodes, members, member dimensions, member masses, connectivity, member type (beam, column, brace, wall)


structural analysis
Inputs: model, engineering properties, and ground motion
Outputs: time history analysis results

can be various levels of complexity. Likely going to start with each floor is a DOF model and only include lateral system. 
will not include non-linear effects as balsa wood is fairly linear.
may or may not include big P-delta 
may or may not include small P-delta (likely not necessary as no member end moments)


optimization
  optimization algorithm
  objective function
  pre-analysis boundaries
  post-analysis boundaries
  "procedural generation"

3D visualization
